Description: Algebra of operations for blending, copying, adjusting, and 
    compositing layers in 'ggplot2'. Supports copying and adjusting the 
    aesthetics or parameters of an existing layer, partitioning a layer 
    into multiple pieces for re-composition, and combining layers (or 
    partitions of layers) using blend modes (like "multiply", "overlay", etc).
