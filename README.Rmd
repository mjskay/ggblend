*ggblend* adds support for blend modes (like `"multiply"`, `"overlay"`, etc)
to *ggplot2*. It requires R >= 4.2, as blending and compositing support was added
in that version of R.

## Installation

You can install the development version of *ggblend* using:

```r
remotes::install_github("mjskay/ggblend")
```

## Example
